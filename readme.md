# Callback Gateway

A gateway to let long running tasks call back web browsers through a push server mechanism.


## Overview

Motivation: we do not want to implement server push and session management on APIs that are intended to be stateless (REST API). The callback gateway is here to maintain deported state to manage server push.

Notes:

* API which do the actual work must accept a callback URL
* Callback URL is formed as `{ws host domain}/callback/{websocket UUID}`

We can imagine some alternative regarding security and authentication:

1. WebSocket server does not handle any authentication and
   1. Remove connection if not push has been proceed from backend API for the registration id
   2. Does not follow data but only send notifications
2. WebSocket rely on token and
   1. Must validate authentication from backend API
   2. Follow data or send notifications


Various

* Resilience and scalability: WSS can live behind a virtual address to ensure no SPOF and scalability. But each WSS has its own clients set bounded. If server A fail abruptly (without properly releasing sockets handles) another server has to relay notifications. On the other side, the client is expected to retry to establish a connection. It may succeed on WSS B. But during this time, an backend API may have called WSS VIP to notify clients. We can circumvent this use case by setting several counter measures as:
* Setup a database which stores pending notifications. A WSS B receiving a notification from API will not be able to follow the notification to a client because the client recipient is not in Bâ€™s pool of client. So, it has to register the notification in the DB table PENDING_NOTIFICATIONS
* Each time a client open a connection to a WSS, the WSS search for pending notifications to send to the client
ClientId is a UUID given at first connection of a client. Each time a client tries to re-open a connection it must resend its clientId for the WSS to be able to follow pending notifications
* Each WSS has its in memory set of client identified as a webSocket
* Each time a WSS receive a notification from API, it checks if client recipient is it client pool. If not it search in DB in table REGISTRATIONS where lies WSS adress, WSS id along with every clientId in its pool. If received notification is not in WSS pool, it search the recipient and call it directly (same network) to send the notification. If it is timed-out, notification is registres in PENDING_NOTIFICATIONS. No matter on which WSS client registers, WSS will search PENDING_NOTIFICATION table


Notification Relayer works in a network of relayers to ensure reliability, scalability and resilience.
Each instance is able to talk to another.

WSS table
- id: string, the server id, primary key
- address: string, the server's url

REGISTRATIONS table
- clientId: UUID, id of the client / registration, primary key
- serverId: string, name of the server instance

PENDING_NOTIFICATIONS table
- clientId: UUID, unique

## Implementation

```bash
deno run -A --watch src\index.ts
```

* WebSockets https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/express/websockets

* From MDN doc
[Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)
* [Web-Push package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) relates Google Cloud Messaging
* [websockets-with-deno](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-websockets-with-deno/)
* needs a script included in client
